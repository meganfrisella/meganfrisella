### Hi there, I'm Megan!

Pronouns: she/her

I'm a junior at Brown pursuing a degree in Mathematics and Computer Science. 
This GitHub account contains some of the projects I've worked on over the past few years. 
Please feel free to check them out.

ðŸ”¬ **Current research**: 
* As a cyber security intern under Dr. Joshua Guttman at MITRE, I am working on producing a secure implementation of cryptographic key distribution
protocol that is specified in [CPSA](https://github.com/mitre/cpsa). A security-by-composition approach is taken, which combines formal
reasoning from separation logic, permission theory, mathematical proofs. 
* As an undergraduate researcher under Professor Malte Schwarzkopf at Brown, I am working to reduce OOM kills on compute clusters via revokable ("soft") memory. A custom memory allocator differentiates revokable from canonical memory, and a memory daemon commands processes to give up revokable memory for needier processes in times of memory pressure. Current work is to integrate the system with the [Redis](https://aws.amazon.com/redis/) in-memory cache as an example for end-to-end testing. 

ðŸ–¥ **Teaching**: 
* During Fall 2022, I'm an Undergraduate TA for [CS1650](https://cs.brown.edu/courses/csci1650/); Software Security and Exploitation. 
* During Spring 2022, I was a Head TA for [CS1710](https://csci1710.github.io/2022/); Logic for Systems.

ðŸ“š **Selected coursework**: Cryptography, Formal Logic, Software Security, Abstract Algebra.
