### Hi there, I'm Megan!

Pronouns: she/her

I'm a Senior at Brown University studying Math and CS. 
This GitHub account contains some of the projects I've worked on over the past few years. 
Please feel free to check them out.

**Resarch Interests**: Programming languages, software verification, systems

ðŸ”¬ **Research**: 
* Improving datacenter efficiency via "soft memory": Defines a new type of flexible memory designed to be revocable in order to avoid OOM terminations and boost overall memory utilization on a machine by redistributing memory when the machine is under memory pressure. [[publication]](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3593856.3595902)
* Proof-oriented imperative programming: Assisting the development of an F* DSL called Pulse. Pulse is a proof-oriented imperative programming language written on top of a concurrent separation logic. My contributions are identifying language limitations, bugs, and candidate patterns for proof automation. I also produce a verified implementation of DICE in Pulse -- DICE is a protocol for firmware identification and attestation. Work done May-August 2023 at Microsoft Research under the advising of Nikhil Swamy. 
* Verified cryptographic protocols: Produced a verified implementation of a cryptographic key distribution protocol that I specified in [CPSA](https://github.com/mitre/cpsa), modeled in Alloy, and wrote in Rust. Used a security-by-composition technique, combining reasoning about separation logic, Rust permission theory, and mathematical proofs. Work done May-August 2022 at MITRE under the advising of Joshua Guttman. 

ðŸ–¥ **Teaching**: 
* 2-time Head Teaching Assistant for an introductory formal methods course at Brown: [CS1710](https://csci1710.github.io/2022/), Logic for Systems.
