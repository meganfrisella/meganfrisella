### Hi there, I'm Megan!

Pronouns: she/her

I'm a rising sophomore at Brown pursuing a degree in Computer Science and Mathematics. 
This GitHub account contains some of the projects I've worked on over the past few years. 
Please feel free to check them out.

ðŸ”¬ **Current research**: (i) Bias in face verification systems at MIT Lincoln Laboratory, (ii) Predicting gene expression in glioblastoma patients at Brown's Singh Lab.

ðŸ“š **Favorite courses thus far**: Introduction to systems, Logic for systems, Real analysis, and a philosophy class on ethics in big tech.

ðŸ§­ **Near future aspirations**: (i) Continue my current research projects to end up with some cool results, (ii) Explore software engineering at an innovative company this Winter and/or next Summer.

ðŸš€ **Future aspirations**: (i) Pursue a graduate degree in some area of computer science (TBD, but I'm interested in algorithms/efficiency and machine learning), (ii) End up doing research in industry or academia!
