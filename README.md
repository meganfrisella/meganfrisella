### Hi there, I'm Megan!

Pronouns: she/her

I'm a Senior at Brown University studying Math and CS. 
This GitHub account contains some of the projects I've worked on over the past few years. 
Please feel free to check them out.

**Resarch Interests**: Programming languages, software verification, systems

ðŸ”¬ **Research**: 
* Improving datacenter efficiency via "soft memory": Defines a new type of flexible memory designed to be revocable in order to avoid OOM terminations and boost overall memory utilization on a machine by redistributing memory when the machine is under memory pressure. [[publication]](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3593856.3595902)
* Proof-oriented imperative programming: Helping inform the development of Pulse, a proof-oriented imperative programming language built on top of Steel (a concurrent separation logic written in F*) by identifying language limitations, bugs, and candidate patterns for proof automation. Producing a verified implementation of [DICE](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/project/dice-device-identifier-composition-engine/) -- a protocol for firmware identification and attestation -- in Pulse.  
* Verified cryptographic protocols: Produced a verified implementation of a cryptographic key distribution protocol specified in [CPSA](https://github.com/mitre/cpsa) and written in Rust. Used a security-by-composition technique, combining reasoning about separation logic, Rust permission theory, and mathematical proofs. Work done May-August 2022 at MITRE under the advising of Dr. Joshua Guttman. 

ðŸ–¥ **Teaching**: 
* 2-time Head Teaching Assistant for an introductory formal methods course at Brown: [CS1710](https://csci1710.github.io/2022/), Logic for Systems.
